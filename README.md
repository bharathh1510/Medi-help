>In this covid period there is a lot of shortage for hospital beds and hospital cylinders. Even if the beds are available people aren't aware of the availability. So we designed an app so that the users can directly view where the beds are available and can book them.

>The user can login can be done by registering the details or through google sign in... more options can be added in the future.
In the home page, directly you can view the hospital names and their images. Below the name, we can see the beds and oxygen cylinders price.

>If we want to book any, we just need to check the box beside that and do the payment.
On the top right corner of the home page, we can see a menu where we'll be having profile contacting details, settings and logout option.

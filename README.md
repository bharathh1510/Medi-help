## Idea behind the project 
>The main aim behind this project is to create an interface where people can find out where there beds available in the hospital. In this covid-pandemic, the number of hospital beds and oxygen cyliders available are limited and the number of cases are increasing in an exponential rate.

>Sometimes, even though there are beds available, many people are not aware. We came with the idea of connecting the hospitals to the citizens where the citizens can book the hospital beds and oxygen cylinders for a limited amount of time.

## Project implementation
>The project is still in development state and we plan to complete the app in 3 phases. For the time-being, only phase-1 is ready providing the basic functions like authentication, hospitals and pharmacies of single city which we want to implement in phase-1 and connecting app with google maps so that the user can go the hospital directly from his location.

>The phase-2 consists of storing user profile in databases, adding payment gateways and implementing the app across the 2 states by adding the cities and hospitals in that cities.

>The phase-3 consist of expanding the app by making it usable throughout the whole country.
